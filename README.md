# Caricature-Photo-Recognition
Match Caricature and photo pairs. It is an interesting task, isn't it?

The training data is very large. If you want to try it, you can download it from [WebCaricature](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/rl/WebCaricature.htm)

Based on [SephereNet](http://www.cvlibs.net/publications/Coors2018ECCV.pdf), I added CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) to extract features on each pair of image.

It achieved high accuracy and outperformed the other algorithms. Our paper *"Gated Fusion of Discriminant Features for Caricature Recognition"* has been accepeted by IScIDE2019, which you can read later.
